# Fastest Presser

Small JavaScript game: two users compete about who can press a key the most times within a set time. A user specifies how long time the game should be, and presses "start". When the button is pressed it is about pressing either l or s on the keyboard. The user that has the highest number of keypresses after the time is up, wins 🎉
